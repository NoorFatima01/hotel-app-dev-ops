//In the provided code snippet, the app.use(cors(...)) middleware is being used to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for a Node.js application. CORS is a security feature implemented by web browsers to restrict webpages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the original webpage. This restriction is known as the same-origin policy.

//When you're building a web application, there are scenarios where you might want to make requests from a frontend (typically running on a different domain or port) to a backend server. CORS headers help in relaxing the same-origin policy, allowing these cross-origin requests under controlled conditions.

// Here's an explanation of the options used in your cors middleware:

// origin: Specifies the origin (or origins) that are allowed to access the resources on the server. In your case, you've set it to "http://localhost:7000", meaning that requests from this specific origin are allowed. You can also use a wildcard "*" to allow any origin, but this is less secure and should be used cautiously.

// credentials: When set to true, it indicates that the server should include credentials (such as cookies, HTTP authentication, and client certificates) in the cross-origin request. This is important when you're dealing with authentication or other scenarios where cookies need to be sent with the request.
